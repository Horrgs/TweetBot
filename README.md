# TweetBot
A Java tweet bot made by Horrgs.

## Goals
Add an AI (Artificial Intelligence) aspect to it.

### Goals of the AI Aspect
Have it be able to gather information such as news using the Google News API, Reddit threads that may appeal to me using jReddit and implementing Jabberwacky which is just a conversation with a bot.

## Commands
All commands will start with % as it's a rare character to Twitter. Right now the only commands are "%help" "%coinflip" and "%theydsaywhat".
